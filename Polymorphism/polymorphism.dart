// before polymorphism need to understanding of Inheritance.

// poly = many, morph = forms   means 'ManyForms' - 'MultipleForms'
// As Humans, we have abilities to take many forms Like, We can be Student, Labour, Teacher, Parent, Friend

// It is the core concept of OOp's Programing
// Polymorphism allow to " Objects of different classes to be treated as object of common superclass. "

// Polymorphism is updating or modifying the features, function or implementation that already exists in parent class

// In polymorphism @overriding method, when we create object the type of reference is Parent class
// but Object type it can be multiple forms according to the need of child class like,
// Animal animal1 = Dog() ;
// Animal animal2 = Cat() ;



// Here, Reference type : Animal , Object type = Dog(), Cat()
