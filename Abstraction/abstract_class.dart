// before abstract class learn constructor and inheritance


/// Difference between Concrete class and Abstract class

/// Concrete Class :
// Class which objects is creatable.
// We can create object of Concrete class.

/// Abstract Class :
// Class which objects is not creatable.
// We can not create object of abstract class


/// Abstract Class :
// Class that can not be initialized.
// declare class using " Abstract " keyword.
// Use to define behavior/method of class that can be inherited by other classes.
// It focus on hiding complex implementation logic of system and expose only needable coe logic.


/// Key concepts of Abstraction :

/// Abstract Class :
// It can contain implemented or without implemented ( body less ) method.
// A class that can not be instantiated.

/// Abstract Method :
// A method that do not have body.
// Child class must need to implement abstract class methods
